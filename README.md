# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects – Python

This repository showcases **three real-world Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects** developed using Python. Each project focuses on transforming raw datasets into meaningful insights that support **data-driven decision-making**.

The primary objective of these projects is to explore data patterns, identify relationships between variables, and generate actionable insights that can be used for business, healthcare, and product strategy decisions.

The analysis was performed using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, with all work documented in **Jupyter Notebooks** for clarity and reproducibility.

## 1. Hotel Booking Analysis

### Situation

The hospitality industry faces frequent booking cancellations, which directly impact revenue and operational planning. Understanding customer booking behavior and identifying cancellation patterns is essential to minimize losses and improve forecasting accuracy.

### Task

The goal of this analysis was to:

* Identify patterns and trends in booking cancellations
* Understand customer booking behavior
* Analyze factors influencing hotel revenue and occupancy

### Action

* Cleaned missing values and corrected data types
* Performed univariate and bivariate analysis
* Analyzed the relationship between lead time and cancellations
* Studied booking trends across countries, room types, and seasons
* Created clear visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Result

* Identified a strong relationship between **long lead times and higher cancellation rates**
* Discovered seasonal peaks in bookings and cancellations
* Found specific customer segments with higher cancellation behavior
* Delivered insights that can help hotels reduce cancellations and improve revenue planning

## 2. Heart Health Analysis

### Situation

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early identification of health risk factors is critical for prevention and better medical decision-making.

### Task

This analysis aimed to:

* Identify key health indicators related to heart disease
* Understand patterns and correlations in patient health data

### Action

* Cleaned and preprocessed patient health data
* Conducted correlation analysis among medical features
* Compared key health metrics such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure
* Used visualizations to explore disease trends and distributions

### Result

* Identified major risk factors associated with heart disease
* Found strong correlations between specific medical attributes
* Generated insights that can support **predictive modeling and early diagnosis**

## 3. App Insight EDA

### Situation

App marketplaces contain thousands of applications across multiple categories. Businesses need data-backed insights to understand what drives app success in terms of ratings, installs, and user engagement.

### Task

The objective was to:

* Analyze rating trends across apps
* Understand install behavior and growth patterns
* Identify top-performing categories and genres

### Action

* Cleaned inconsistent data in installs, price, and ratings
* Created install-based bins for better segmentation
* Analyzed the relationship between ratings and installs
* Compared categories using grouped and aggregated analysis
* Visualized trends to highlight performance differences

### Result

* Identified categories with the highest average ratings
* Observed a positive relationship between higher ratings and installs
* Discovered insights that can guide **app development and growth strategy**
