#  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects – Python

This repository contains three real-world Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects using Python.
The goal of these projects is to extract insights from raw data and support data-driven decision-making.

I used **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for analysis and visualization.

# 1️ Hotel Booking Analysis

## Situation

The hotel industry faces high booking cancellations and revenue uncertainty. Understanding customer behavior is important to reduce loss.

## Task

Analyze hotel booking data to:

* Identify cancellation patterns
* Understand customer booking behavior
* Find factors affecting revenue

## Action

* Cleaned missing values and handled data types
* Performed univariate and bivariate analysis
* Analyzed lead time vs cancellation
* Studied booking trends by country, room type, and season
* Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Result

* Found strong relation between **lead time and cancellations**
* Identified peak booking months
* Discovered which customer segments cancel more
* Provided insights that can help reduce cancellation rate

# Heart Health Analysis

## Situation

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death. Early analysis of health indicators can help in prevention.

## Task

Analyze patient health data to:

* Identify important health risk factors
* Study patterns related to heart disease

## Action

* Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
* Checked correlation between variables
* Compared health metrics (age, cholesterol, blood pressure)
* Used visualizations to understand disease patterns

## Result

* Identified key factors affecting heart disease
* Found strong correlation between certain medical features
* Generated insights useful for predictive modeling

# App Insight EDA

## Situation

App stores contain thousands of apps. Understanding ratings, installs, and categories helps businesses improve app strategy.

## Task

Analyze app dataset to:

* Study rating trends
* Understand install patterns
* Identify top-performing categories

## Action

* Cleaned inconsistent data (installs, price, ratings)
* Created install-based bins
* Analyzed rating vs installs
* Compared genres using grouped analysis
* Visualized trends over time

## Result

* Identified categories with highest average ratings
* Found relationship between installs and rating
* Discovered patterns useful for app growth strategy
